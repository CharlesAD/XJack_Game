                <p>Time to beat the dealer. Your score is the total value of your cards.<br> 
                    The aim of the game is to get your score to 21 or as close as possible without<br> 
                    going over otherwise you will go BUST!!! If you're closer to 21 than the dealer<br>
                    you win. If you and the dealer have the same score than it's a draw. </p>

                        <p> 2) There is only one dealer and one player</p>
                        <p> 3) If the Dealer's total is 16 or less they must draw and if it is 17 or more they must stand</p>
                        <p> 4) The dealer cannot "Hit" or "Stay". One the player is capable of this</p>
