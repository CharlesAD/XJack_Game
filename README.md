Welcome to my blackjack Project! I hope you have as much fun playing with it as I did making it. Enjoy! 



Game/Project Assumptions

Card Values:

Ace = 11 or 1
King = 10
Queen = 10
Joker = 10
9 of any suit = 9
8 of any suit = 8
7 of any suit = 7
6 of any suit = 6
5 of any suit = 5
4 of any suit = 4
3 of any suit = 3
2 of any suit = 2

1) If a player draws an ace while his current hand total is equal to 11 or greater, they will choose for their Ace card to be of value 1

2) There is only one dealer and one player

3) If the Dealer's total is 16 or less they must draw and if it is 17 or more they must stand

4) The dealer cannot "Hit" or "Stay". One the player is capable of this

5) The player can "Hit" or "Stay" as many times as they would like

6) Once you have decided the value of your Ace card you cannot change it

7) If both the Dealer and The Player hit 21 the game ends in a draw

My Steps

- Create decks

- Shuffle deck

- Start game

- Deal cards

- Check if the Dealer or yourself has BlackJack (score of 21) or anyone is "Bust" (score over 21)

- Allow player to "Hit" or "Stay"

- Did you win, lose or tie?
