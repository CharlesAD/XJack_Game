# XJack - Blackjack Game

XJack is a simple browser-based Blackjack game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an intense and enjoyable gaming experience where players aim to beat the dealer and get their score as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Gameplay

- The player starts the game by clicking the "Start Game" button on the start screen.
- Once the game starts a 10 second countdown timer has started, the player is dealt two initial cards, and the dealer is also dealt cards but you can only see one.
- The dealer will draw cards until their total is 17 or more.
- The player can choose to "Hit" to receive another card or "Stay" to end their turn.
- Before the player chooses to "Stay" they have the chance to "Boost" take a chance of adding a random score between 1 and 5 to their score or "Freeze" pause the countdown but a penalty of 3 points will be added to the players score.
- The player's score is compared to the dealer's score, and the outcome (Win, Lose, or Draw) is displayed.


## Features

- **Score Boost**: The player can activate the Score Boost feature to add bonus points to their score.
- **Freeze**: The player can use the Freeze feature to pause the countdown timer but they will gain additional points.
- **Countdown Timer**: A 10-second countdown timer adds excitement to the game.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as a learning exercise and is based on various online resources. It takes some inspiration from the classic card game BlackJack. My goals was the create an exciting fast paced version of the game as in the past I haven't enjoyed playing the classic game. The game doesn't involve strategies such as doubling down, splitting pairs, or insurance bets found in traditional Blackjack. My new features "Boost" and "Freeze" speeds up the game play and maintains the players attention. Changing these features into my own unique features enhances the game play being it closer to my initial goal of an exciting game. 




I hope you have as much fun playing with it as I did making it. Enjoy!
